Notes:

1. Run: Ruby Command.rb

2. Choose your workspace

3. Input the file you want to use for create, update, read or delete iterations.

4. If create, choose whether you want to create for all child projects or not.
 
   In this case, the start date and end date can't duplicate with exist iterations. Or it will give you error.

5. If delete, it can't delete iteration for all child projects. 
   If you want, you have to list all iterations for all projects you want to delete.
